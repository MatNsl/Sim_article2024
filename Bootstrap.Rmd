# Preliminaries

We do not need the artificial forest for now. We just need a virtual 1000x1000 square.

```{r}
# Sample size
n <- 100
```

```{r}
# Marginal density: density of the uniform distribution over 1:1000
# Which leads us to the inclusion density function
pi <- sum(rep((1/1000)*(1/1000), n))
pi
```

# Creating one sample

```{r}
# Dataframe containing all coordinates of n randomly chosen points
random_points <- data.frame(x = rep(0, n), y = rep(0, n))
```

```{r}
# Uniform sampling over the whole territory
random_points$x <- runif(n, 0, 1000)
random_points$y <- runif(n, 0, 1000)
```

# Creating another sample based on the previous one

```{r}
for (point in 1:n) {
  random_points$x
}
```

```{r}
boot()
```
